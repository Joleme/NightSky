CHANGELOG
=========

#### V 1.0.0.0b

-Beta Released

#### V 1.0.0.0

-Official Release

-Next and Previous buttons now work properly.

-The player will loop over when the playlist is over.

-Volume up and Volume down buttons now work with smooth animation.

-Shuffle and Repeat functionalities are done.

-When a music is over it'll play the next if shuffle button is toggled off (It'll play to a random one if it's toggled on).

-You can now maximize the player's window with double click. (Spoiler alert: it's super smooth!)

-Minimize and Close buttons now work properly (You guessed it, it's pretty smooth!)

-There's a settings file available now which you can use to edit the preferences of the player to your own likings!

-Aspect ratio is now respected so no matter the aspect ratio of your monitor or the height and width of the player that you set in the settings file, the player will look the same!

-There also have been a couple of optimization tricks that'll make the player's background loop go even more smoothly.
